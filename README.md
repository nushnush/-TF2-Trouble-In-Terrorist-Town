# TF2 Trouble-In-Terrorist-Town
The Original Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) was made in Garry's Mod. The game is about a group of terrorists who have Traitors among them, out to kill every other 'Innocent' terrorist.

At the start of the round, players are randomly selected to become a Traitor, unknown to other players who aren't Traitors themselves.

For the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even? The round ends if either group is wiped out or if the timer ends. In which case, the Innocents win.
